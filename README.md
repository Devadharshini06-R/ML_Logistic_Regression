# ML_Logistic_Regression

## *Overview*

The implementation of Logistic regression for solving a classification problem using python 

The dataset contains both categorical and numerical features which are preprocessed before applying the logistic regression model 


### üõ†Ô∏è Steps in Notebook

**Importing Libraries** ‚Äì NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn.

**Loading the Dataset** ‚Äì Using pd.read_csv().

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** ‚Äì

Check missing values

Distribution of features

Correlation heatmap

**Data Preprocessing** ‚Äì

Encoding categorical variables (LabelEncoder / OneHotEncoder)

Feature scaling (StandardScaler)

**Train-Test Split** ‚Äì Splitting data into 80% training and 20% testing.

**Model Building** ‚Äì Logistic Regression from sklearn.linear_model.

**Model Evaluation** ‚Äì

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

**Visualization** ‚Äì

Confusion Matrix Heatmap

Decision Boundary (for 2D features)


### üìä Results

Logistic Regression model built successfully.

Achieved accuracy around XX% (replace with your result).

Precision, Recall, and F1-score are analyzed for better understanding.
